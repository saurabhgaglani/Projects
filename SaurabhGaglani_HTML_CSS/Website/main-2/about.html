<li> Why Ecochip? </li>
<p>Ecochip is named after a very important environmental movement in India- The "Chipko movement." In the 1970's, pieces of forest land were being auctioned off to contractors which led to heavy deforestation.
The Indian women who lived in those areas started forming groups and standing up agains the commercial operations. They organised peqceful protests against the lumberjacks and their contractors, but this failed 
and the contractors started abusing them and threatening them with guns. The women were not shirked though, and they resorted to hugging the trees to stop the lumberjacks from chopping them.
This movement inspired a lot of eco-friendly movements and led to a lot of afforestation.
